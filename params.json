{"name":"eegwave.github.io","tagline":" EEGWave ","body":"The EEGWave is a MATLAB semi-automated toolbox to quantitatively analyze the temporal progression of brain oscillatory activity in multiple free-running LFP recordings obtained during spontaneous behaviors. The algorithm works by selecting LFP epochs at user-defined onset times (locked to behavior, drug injection time, etc), calculates their time-frequency spectra, detects long-lasting oscillatory events and calculates linear coherence between pair of electrodes. As output, it generates several table-like text and tiff image files, besides group descriptive statistics. It also calculates the global spectral composition per epoch from each subject and the linear coherence (with confidence intervals) as a measure of spectral synchronization between brain regions. the output files provide an easy way to do within-subject as well as across-subject analysis.
